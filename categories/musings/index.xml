      <description>So I read this Medium post about how you should get up really early in the morning and work very focused for about 5 ours before doing anything else.
Well - I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna get up at 5am as the guy who wrote the post does. That&amp;rsquo;s just not me. But I am gonna get up at before 7am and make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m ready to work by that time. Why?</description>
