<h1 id="i-have-a-new-schedule">I have a new schedule!</h1>

<h3 id="do-you-want-to-see-it">Do you want to see it?</h3>

<p>So I read this <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-structure-your-day-for-optimal-performance-and-productivity-dcbf0665e3f3">Medium post</a>
about how you should get up really early in the morning and work very focused for about 5 ours before doing anything else.</p>

<p>Well - I&rsquo;m not gonna get up at 5am as the guy who wrote the post does. That&rsquo;s just not me. But I <strong>am</strong> gonna get up at <em>before</em> 7am and make sure that I&rsquo;m ready to work by that time. Why? Because the post outlines a thing, that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a while.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being focused while working matters. A lot! - Probably Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway. I&rsquo;m writing this a 12:30 am sooooh, but I promises I will. keep. to. this. schedule.</p>

<p>So without further ado - my day:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Before 7am (preferably 6:30am):</strong> GET UP. Make some coffee and oatmeal. Sit down at my computer. Contemplate if there&rsquo;s time. Or meditate.</li>
<li><strong>7am - 11am</strong>: Get an overview of what needs to be done. Open my über cool <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro</a> timer app and get to work.</li>
<li><strong>11am - 1pm</strong>: Lunch and gym (also shower)</li>
<li><strong>1pm - ~5pm</strong>: Got more work to do? Go to a café. Order an americano and get going. Also meetings. And catching up with friends family etc.</li>
<li><strong>5pm - ~8pm</strong>: Dinner and quality time with the missus or friends.</li>
<li><strong>8pm - ~23am</strong>: Got even more work? (really? It won&rsquo;t be quality at this time, so it better be routine stuff.) Do it! If not: Write blog posts. Watch tv. Have fun. Contemplate.</li>
<li><strong>Before 12am</strong>: Go to bed already.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that&rsquo;s my new day! Not getting up to early. I don&rsquo;t need the early mornings to have quiet time. I work mostly from home and my girlfriend leaves before 7am anyway, so I have plenty of wiggle room for my brain to operate in. Also blocked out time for <em>not work</em>. This is key to not getting burned out (and keeping my SO). Still on really busy days I have a good 11 hours to work in!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have more stuff on <strong>pomodoro</strong> and how this works out for me.</p>
